Installation
============

*SCARLET* has several dependencies that must be installed prior to installation:

#. numpy_
#. proxmin_ (proximal algorithms used to minimize the likelihood)
#. pybind11_ (integrate C++ code into python)
#. peigen_ (used to load the Eigen_ headers if they are not already installed)
#. autograd_ (needed to calculate gradients during optimization)

Optional Dependencies (required to build docs)

#. matplotlib_ (required to use the plotting functionality in `scarlet.display`)
#. astropy_ (required for visualization, some of the tutorials, and sample data)
#. scipy_ (required for nearest neighbor monotonicity and estimating a target PSF kernel)
#. sphinx_ (required to build the docs)
#. sphinx_rtd_theme_ (required to use the Read the Docs theme)
#. nbsphinx_ (required to compile notebooks)
#. numpydoc_ (allow for numpy style docstrings)

From Source
-----------
First download the github repo:
::

    git clone https://github.com/fred3m/scarlet.git

then install using:
::

    python setup.py install

*SCARLET* requires the Eigen_ library headers, which are downloaded automatically when using the
command above.
If you already have a local version of Eigen_ and don't want to download the headers, use

::

    python setup.py build_ext -I<full path to your Eigen header files>
    python setup.py install

.. warning::
    `build_ext` does not accept relative paths, so `<full path to your Eigen header files>`
    must be a full path.

Building the Docs
=================

If you wish to build the docs you will need all of the optional dependencies installed.
Then navigate to the `docs` directory and type
::

    make html

and a local copy of the current docs will be available in the `docs/_build/html` folder.
The home page is available at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
